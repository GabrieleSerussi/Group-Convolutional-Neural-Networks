# Group-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Group Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs) are a generalization of CNNs that reduces the data complexity by exploiting symmetries using Group Theory (you can learn more on the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576)). This method provides an alternative to data augmentation, it increases the expressive capacity
of the network without increasing the number of parameters by using weight sharing.
In this repository you will see the result of applying G-CNNs on the [Fashion-MNIST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747) dataset with rotations of multiples of 90 degrees.
