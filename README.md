# Group-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Group Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs) are a generalization of CNNs that reduces the data complexity by exploiting symmetries using Group Theory (you can learn more on the original paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576). In this repository you will see the result of applying G-CNNs on the Fashion-MNIST dataset with rotations
